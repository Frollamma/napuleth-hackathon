- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Install

1. Clone this repo

2. Be sure submodules have been downloaded:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

3. Install dependencies

```sh
cd my-dapp-example
yarn install
```

## Extra install (base sepolia)

Follow [this guide](https://docs.base.org/learn/foundry/deploy-with-foundry) to set up your environment to deploy on base sepolia. There's also a `.env.example` that you can copy to `.env` to help you.

## Extra install (avalanche)

Follow [this guide](https://build.avax.network/docs/tooling/create-avalanche-l1) to set up your environment to deploy locally on your avalanche L1.

To set the PATH fish use this:

```
set -x PATH ~/bin $PATH
```

If everything goes well you'll see:

## Run (local)

You can run on a local chain by following these steps:

1. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```sh
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Foundry. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `packages/foundry/foundry.toml`.

2. On a second terminal, deploy the contracts:

```sh
yarn deploy
```

3. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```sh
yarn start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## Run (base sepolia)

You can run on Base Sepolia by following these steps:

1. In a first terminal, deploy the contracts:

```sh
yarn deploy-base-sepolia
```

2. On a second terminal, start your NextJS app:

```sh
yarn start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## Run (avalanche)

You can run on Avalanche by following these steps:

1. In a first terminal, deploy the contracts:

```sh
